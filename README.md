# Zutphen Station Project

Welcome to the Zutphen Station project, an educational endeavor created using Three.js. This project marks the first time I, as a developer, have worked with Three.js. It was developed in collaboration with another student.

## Overview

This project aims to recreate the Zutphen station with a blend of reality and artistic vision. 
## Features

- **Imported and Custom Models**: The project features a combination of imported models and custom models created by us using Three.js.
- **Interactive Animations**: Includes animations such as water running in the fountain and transport moving on the roads, making the scene lively and engaging.
- **Skybox and Textures**: A detailed skybox and various textures enhance the visual appeal of the project.
- **MVC Pattern**: The project is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, promoting organized and maintainable code.
